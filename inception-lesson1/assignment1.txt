# what is emmet?
  Emmet is a free add-on for text editors that allows developers to type shortcuts that
   are then expanded into full pieces of code. Emmet is built-in in many text editors like VS Code.

# Diff bw Library and framework?
  the key distinction between libraries and frameworks is in the level of control and structure they provide.
 Libraries are more like tools that you use in your code, while frameworks are comprehensive structures that you 
 build your code within.

# What is CDN? Why do we use it?
  A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of geographically distributed servers designed to 
  efficiently deliver web content, such as images, stylesheets, JavaScript files, and other assets, 
  to users based on their geographical location.
  CDNs are used in React applications to enhance performance, reliability, and security.
  By leveraging a CDN, you can ensure that your React application loads quickly, is highly available, and efficiently 
  serves users across the globe, all while reducing the load on your server infrastructure. 
  This is particularly valuable in modern web development, where user experience and site performance are critical.

# what is crossorigin in script tag in react?
  The crossorigin attribute is used in the <script> tag when loading external JavaScript files
   in a React or HTML application. It specifies how the browser should handle requests for 
   cross-origin resources, i.e., resources that are hosted on a different domain than the one where your 
   React application is running. 
  This attribute is commonly used for security and to control access to resources.

# React vs ReactDOM
  ReactDOM is a package in the React ecosystem that provides the necessary bindings for rendering React components 
  into the actual DOM of a web page. It essentially bridges the gap between React's virtual DOM and the 
  browser's real DOM. ReactDOM is specifically focused on web applications and web development. 
  Developers use ReactDOM methods
  like ReactDOM.render() to mount React components into the HTML structure of a web page.

   React is the core library for building user interfaces, while ReactDOM is an essential part of the React 
   ecosystem that deals with rendering React components into the browser's DOM. The two work together to create 
   interactive and dynamic web applications. It's not a matter of React vs. ReactDOM; 
   rather, they complement each other to achieve the desired functionality in web development.

# diffn bw react.devlopment.js and react.production.js via cdn?
    When deploying a React application to a production environment, it is advisable to use
     the react.production.js version for better performance and a smaller bundle size. During development, 
    you can use react.development.js to take advantage of the additional debugging features it provides

# async vs defer
    async
    When you include a <script> tag with the async attribute, the browser will begin downloading the script 
    file immediately. However, it won't block the parsing of the HTML document.
    The script will be executed as soon as it's downloaded, potentially before the HTML document is fully parsed. 
    <script src="example.js" async></script>

    defer 
    When you include a <script> tag with the defer attribute, the browser will also begin downloading the 
    script immediately, 
    but it will defer the execution of the script until after the HTML document is fully parsed.
